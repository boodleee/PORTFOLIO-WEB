# PORTFOLIO-WEB 
Hi! This is Giovrei Ortega from BSIT - 1112. 

To access my portfolio website, click this link:

Once you've accessed the FLOW website, you'll be welcomed by the Homepage. 
This page includes the promotion for the SDG as well as its details.
note: don't forget to get yourselves a glass of water ;)

There are 4 tabs on the upper-right part of the website:
1. Profile - This includes my personal information, background information, and technical skills.
2. Projects - This solely showcases the projects I've made in my career.
3. About - This explains the purpose and existence of the website.
4. Contact - This can be navigated to contact the owner, which is me :>
