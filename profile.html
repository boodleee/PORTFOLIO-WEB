        <h2>Know More About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Giovrei Ortega, a first-year BSIT student at Batangas State University.
            From a young age, I was captivated by how technology shapes the world around us. I spent countless hours tinkering with gadgets, learning about how they worked, and exploring digital designs. This curiosity eventually led me to pursue a degree in Information Technology. As an aspiring web developer, I realized that coding is not just about writing lines of text—it’s about creating something that can help solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve always had a strong creative side, and web development felt like the perfect way to combine that with technology. When I first started learning programming, I faced many challenges—understanding the logic behind code and figuring out how to bring ideas to life on a screen. But with every line of code I wrote, I gained a deeper appreciation for how powerful the web can be in connecting people and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I am focused on using my developing skills to work on projects that can make a difference. This website, dedicated to SDG 6—Clean Water and Sanitation—is one such project. It’s my way of merging my passion for technology with my growing awareness of global issues. I am excited to continue learning, experimenting, and using my skills to create websites that are not just functional, but also purposeful and impactful.
